# Apollo GraphOS for Travel

This repo provides a demonstration supergraph for a travel company. You can explore the schema and run queries against it in [Apollo Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com/public/apollo-travel-supergraph/variant/prod/home). We encourage you to also use the schema as inspiration for your own travel supergraph!

## View the schema
This demo is published to the [Apollo Solutions](https://studio.apollographql.com/org/apollo-solutions) GraphOS
org with the graph
id [apollo-travel-supergraph](https://studio.apollographql.com/graph/apollo-travel-supergraph).

You can also view and share the [public variant](https://studio.apollographql.com/public/apollo-travel-supergraph/variant/prod/home) to run queries right from Explorer.
